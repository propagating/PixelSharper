# PixelSharper

A C# translation, with some changes, of the Pixel Game Engine written by Javidx9. 

This project is the core focus of the Youtube series 'Two's Complement' created by myself (propagating) in an effort to learn more about game engine development, C#, C++, and programming in general. 

Upon completion, PixelSharper will be used as a backbone for a NES emulator called NESharp (it's written in C#, so sharp must be in the name). That project will similarly based on Javidx9's NES Emultaor series.
